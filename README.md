# Spacer3000
In the year 3000 of an unknown calendar derived from an unknown religion practiced by an unknown species on an unknown planet in an unknown star system in an unknown galaxy,
you are the last hope of an unknown civilization trapped on a planet succumbing to atmospheric pollution. Your peers have tasked you with finding a planet to call home.
For this purpose, they send you off into space on the first of 7, 128-story rockets outfitted with zero exits.

Make your way from the core to the far-flung reaches of the galaxy and beyond if necessary on a quest for a planet just like the one you came from. Just like the one you came from, without the inescapably thick smoke and the piles of industrial waste hidden beneath it, it should go without saying.
Good Luck, Spacer! You will need it...
